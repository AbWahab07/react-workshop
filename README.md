# React Workshop

## Thank you!

- [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
- [Matt Zabriskie](https://github.com/mzabriskie) for his [react-workshop](https://github.com/mzabriskie/react-workshop) upon which this one is based.
- [KADIRA](https://github.com/kadirahq) for their [react-storybook](https://github.com/kadirahq/react-storybook)

## Setup

You need to have the latest [`node`](https://nodejs.org/en/), [`yarn`](https://yarnpkg.com/), and [`git`](https://git-scm.com/) installed.
Then run:

```
git clone https://github.com/kentcdodds/react-workshop.git
cd react-workshop
yarn run setup
```

If you don't have `yarn` installed and don't want to use it for some reason, you can use `npm` as well.
Instead of `yarn run setup`, run `npm run setup -- --use-npm` and enjoy waiting (and hopefully things don't break for you).

If you have no errors, you're ready to start the workshop!

If you see any errors, read the output and try to follow any instructions. If that doesn't work, feel free to
[file an issue](https://github.com/kentcdodds/react-workshop/issues/new) to ask for help and I'll help if I can.
Good luck!
